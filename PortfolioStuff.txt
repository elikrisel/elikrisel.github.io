I won't look at your code for fear of liability and because I don't have time. If you have a game, provide a precompiled Windows version and (more importantly) 
screenshots/video demonstrating features you're proud of. I will definitely look at screenshots.

For the most part, the only thing I care about your portfolio is how it shows the level of complexity you can handle. Listing the technically challenging/innovative features that you implemented (influence maps? massive actor counts?) 
makes it relevant to me. 
Also gives interesting things to talk about in the interview (what scenario would kill perf of your influence map).
